# HeritageConnect – Bridging Tradition and Technology

A web project designed to blend cultural celebration with digital awareness during Navratri. 

This site was part of our department’s Student Corner display, where a QR code on the noticeboard linked directly to the website. It offered students quick access to Navratri insights, view artwork contributed by my classmates, and experience a blend of cultural themes with technical concepts.

## 🌟 Project Overview

HeritageConnect was created to add a digital layer to our department’s Navratri board.
While the assigned task was only to decorate the noticeboard, this project was voluntarily built to:

- Present Navratri knowledge in a simple, engaging format
- Highlight artwork created by our class
- Encourage participation and coordination within the class
- A clean and accessible interface suitable for quick viewing through QR scanning
- Show how computing and culture can complement each other
- Connect each day’s theme with equivalent ideas from computing
- A bridge between cultural celebration and computing awareness within our department

## 🎨 Art Gallery

A digital archive of the Navratri-themed creative gallery featuring soft copies of the paintings and sketches from our class. 
This preserves student contributions and allows them to be viewed even after the event.
